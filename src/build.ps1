.SYNOPSIS
  Builds, tests and publishes every executable in this repo as a SINGLE self-contained file.

.DESCRIPTION
  One .exe per app, with no .dll beside it and no .NET install needed on the target machine.
  That costs size - each exe carries its own runtime - and it is the point: these are handed to
  people who should not have to install anything.

  How the "no DLLs" part is actually achieved, because each switch matters:

    PublishSingleFile                    packs the managed assemblies into the exe
    IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract native libraries too (none here today; kept so a future native dependency is bundled;
                                         without this they land beside the exe as loose .dll files)
    SatelliteResourceLanguages=en        stops localised resource assemblies creating one
                                         subdirectory per language, each holding a .dll
    DebugType=none                       no .pdb beside the exe
    EnableCompressionInSingleFile        compresses the bundle; roughly halves the size

  NOT used, deliberately: PublishTrimmed. The token tables are built by reflection-free code, but
  trimming has not been tested against the assemblers; do not add it without running every
  round-trip test on the published exe.

.PARAMETER Configuration
  Release (default) or Debug.

.PARAMETER Runtime
  RID to publish for. Default win-x64. linux-x64 and osx-arm64 also work for the console apps.

.PARAMETER Output
  Where the exes go. Default: publish\<Runtime> in the repo root.

.PARAMETER FrameworkDependent
  Publish small exes that need a matching .NET runtime installed, instead of self-contained ones.

.PARAMETER SkipTests
  Do not run the test suites first. The default is to run them and stop on failure - publishing
  binaries nobody tested is how a bad build reaches a machine.

.PARAMETER Clean
  Delete the output directory first.

.EXAMPLE
  .\build.ps1
  .\build.ps1 -Configuration Debug -SkipTests
  .\build.ps1 -Runtime linux-x64 -Output E:\drop
